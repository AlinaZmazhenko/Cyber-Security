# Lab 3 – Email Header Analysis & SPF/DMARC Investigation

## Objective
Analyze a suspicious email to identify the original sending IP address, verify sender authenticity using SPF/DMARC, and determine whether the message is spoofed or malicious.

## Tools Used
- Mozilla Thunderbird
- Email headers
- MXToolbox
- Google Admin Toolbox
- WHOIS lookup
- SPF & DMARC analyzers

## Steps Performed
1. Opened email headers in Thunderbird
2. Identified "Received" chain
3. Extracted original sending IP
4. Checked SPF authentication result
5. Analyzed DMARC policy
6. Performed IP ownership lookup (WHOIS)
7. Evaluated message legitimacy

## Findings
- SPF: Fail
- DMARC: Not properly configured
- Sender domain spoofed
- Sending IP not authorized
- High probability of phishing attempt

## Conclusion
The email was fraudulent and used domain spoofing. Authentication mechanisms were either misconfigured or bypassed.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Email forensics
- Header analysis
- SPF/DMARC validation
- Threat detection
- OSINT (IP attribution)
- SOC investigation workflow
