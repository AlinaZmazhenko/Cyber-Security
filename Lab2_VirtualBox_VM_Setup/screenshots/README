# Lab 2 – Virtual Machine Setup with VirtualBox

## Objective
Create and configure a virtual machine using Oracle VirtualBox, install Windows 10 from an ISO image, and troubleshoot common boot and configuration issues.

---

## Environment
- Host OS: macOS (Intel-based MacBook Pro)
- Hypervisor: Oracle VirtualBox
- Guest OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)
- ISO: Windows 10 22H2 (x64)

---

## VM Configuration
- RAM: 6 GB
- CPU: 2 cores
- Disk: 50 GB (VDI)
- Graphics Controller: VBoxSVGA
- Network: NAT
- Firmware: BIOS (UEFI disabled)

---

## Installation Process
1. Created a new virtual machine in VirtualBox.
2. Allocated system resources (memory, CPU, storage).
3. Attached Windows 10 ISO as optical media.
4. Encountered a boot error due to EFI being enabled.
5. Identified and resolved the issue by disabling EFI and switching to BIOS boot mode.
6. Successfully booted into Windows installer and started OS installation.

---

## Troubleshooting & Findings
- EFI boot caused "No bootable device" error in VirtualBox.
- Disabling EFI resolved the issue.
- Proper ISO attachment is required for initial boot.

---

## Outcome
- Windows 10 VM successfully created and booted.
- Demonstrated understanding of virtualization fundamentals and boot troubleshooting.
- VM ready for further security labs and analysis.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Virtual machine creation
- VirtualBox configuration
- BIOS vs UEFI understanding
- OS installation from ISO
- Troubleshooting boot issues
